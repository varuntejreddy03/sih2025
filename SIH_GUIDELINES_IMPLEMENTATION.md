## 📋 Content Structure Following SIH Guidelines

### **Slide 2 - Problem & Solution**
```
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
• Current systems lack real-time monitoring and analytics
• Limited accessibility for target user demographics  
• Inefficient resource utilization increasing operational costs
• Absence of data-driven decision making processes

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
• AI-powered solution addressing core problem requirements
• Real-time monitoring system with predictive analytics
• User-centric design ensuring accessibility
• Scalable cloud infrastructure supporting growth
• Integration capabilities with existing systems
• Data-driven approach enabling evidence-based decisions

📝 NOTE: Use flowcharts and diagrams to illustrate solution architecture
```

### **Slide 3 - Technical Approach**
```
• Frontend: React Native for cross-platform mobile application
• Backend: Node.js + Express with RESTful API architecture
• Database: MongoDB/PostgreSQL for efficient data management
• Cloud: AWS/Azure with auto-scaling microservices
• AI/ML: TensorFlow/PyTorch for intelligent features
• Security: JWT authentication with end-to-end encryption

🎨 VISUAL REQUIREMENT: Include system architecture diagram showing:
   - Component relationships and data flow
   - User Interface → API Gateway → Microservices → Database
   - Use flowcharts, not text descriptions
```

## 🎯 SIH Presentation Guidelines Integrated

### **Practice & Delivery Tips:**
- ✅ Practice complete pitch multiple times within time limit
- ✅ Tell coherent story: Problem → Solution → Benefits  
- ✅ Include concrete examples and quick demos where possible
- ✅ Anticipate judge questions on feasibility and impact
- ✅ Avoid overloading slides with text - use visuals
- ✅ Keep problem focus - tie every slide back to original challenge

### **Visual Storytelling Requirements:**
- ✅ Architecture diagrams for technical approach
- ✅ Impact metrics charts and beneficiary diagrams
- ✅ Timeline charts showing implementation phases
- ✅ Risk matrix and feasibility analysis charts
- ✅ Flowcharts instead of text descriptions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Content Generation Enhanced:**
```javascript
// SIH-compliant content generation
async function generateAdvancedDomainContent(ps_id, originalContent, deepResearch) {
  return {
    summary: `• AI-powered solution addressing core problem requirements
             • Real-time monitoring system with predictive analytics

## 🔧 Content Enhancer Dropdown Fix

### **Issue Fixed:**
- Added `useEffect` to automatically load generated content
- Improved error handling for API calls
- Better console logging for debugging
- Fallback to empty array on errors

### **Implementation:**
```javascript
// Load generated content when component mounts
useEffect(() => {
  loadGeneratedContent();
}, []);

const loadGeneratedContent = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5001/api/generated_content');
    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      setGeneratedContent(data);
      console.log('Generated content loaded:', data.length, 'items');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading generated content:', error);
    setGeneratedContent([]);
  }
};
```
